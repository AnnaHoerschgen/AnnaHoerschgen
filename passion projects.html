    <h1>Passion Projects</h1>
    <p>
        Before we begin, I find it important to find this proves how I work on my own rather than how I conduct myself doing it. I find it necessary that there is a much-needed disconnect from art and artist. You can like something and NOT like it's creator (or
        vice versa), that is one of my personal philosophies. So, don't take these as a judgement of my character or work ethic, as some of the presented pieces are relatively ancient and/or dated when compared to my modern works.

                    A drawing related to Kitsune Madness. Pictured is Sazhnt shedding his False Hank skin, hence the text "Shed skin". Drawn in MS Paint, which proves that skill and understanding of your tools truly is a factor to the quality of an art piece.

                <p>
                    This is a (sort of) FnaF fangame with twisted characters from another, bigger and foreign, series. F key for your flashlight, which auto-charges from the generator. If the indicator in the top-left starts beeping, then that would be a good time to use
                    your flashlight. If both your generator and flashlight die, or something gets in, it's game over.
