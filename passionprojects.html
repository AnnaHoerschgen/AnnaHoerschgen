    <h1>Passion Projects</h1>
    <p>
        Before we begin, I find it important to find this proves how I work on my own rather than how I conduct myself doing it. I find it necessary that there is a much-needed disconnect from art and artist. You can like something and NOT like it's creator (or
        vice versa), that is one of my personal philosophies. So, don't take these as a judgement of my character or work ethic, as some of the presented pieces are relatively ancient and/or dated when compared to my modern works.
    </p>

                    This is a (sort of) FnaF fangame with twisted characters from another, bigger and foreign, series. F key for your flashlight, which auto-charges from the generator. If the indicator in the top-left starts beeping, then that would be a good time to use
                    your flashlight. If both your generator and flashlight die, or something gets in, it's game over.
