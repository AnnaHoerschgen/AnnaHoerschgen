    <h1>Anna Hoerschgen's Profile</h1>
    <p>
        Hello! I am Anna Hoerschgen! Born in Springfield, Missouri, I'm an 18, almost 19, year old female with interests the world over. I've completed, or are near to completing, classes in mostly graphic design and programming. I enjoy drawing and so most of
        my thinking occurs visually, and sometimes viewing my process can seem like things are being done backwards or I'm ping-ponging between aspects due to how my brain works. While I mostly draw, I also sometimes dabble in animation, coding, writing,
        and other forms of content creation. I'll leave you to browse my previous\current work on this: I work best when things are made simple and straightforward.

                    A drawing related to Kitsune Madness. Pictured is Sazhnt shedding his False Hank skin, hence the text "Shed skin". Drawn in MS Paint, which proves that skill and understanding of your tools truly is a factor to the quality of an art piece.

                    A game that's a mixture of plinko and pinball. During the drop phase, you can use the left and right arrows to move the overhead crane and Spacebar to drop the ball when ready. During the pinball phase, use the w and s keys to use the flippers and click
                    the ball to move it around a bit and get some points.
