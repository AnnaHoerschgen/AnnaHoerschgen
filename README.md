Hello! I am Anna Hoerschgen! Born in Springfield, Missouri, I'm an 18, almost 19, year old female with interests the world over. I've completed, or are near to completing, classes in mostly graphic design and programming. I enjoy drawing and so most of my thinking occurs visually, and sometimes viewing my process can seem like things are being done backwards or I'm ping-ponging between aspects due to how my brain works. While I mostly draw, I also sometimes dabble in animation, coding, writing, and other forms of content creation. My unique creative upbringing made me a yin-yang of programming and art: within every piece of art, there is (at least a basic) understanding of code, and within every statement written in what I code, a little bit of artistry shines through.
